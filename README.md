# BookStore

An E-commerce presence for a company called BookStore which sells books online.

This project is all about learning more about Django and how to use it to build real world application for online businesses.

Motivation: From studying a book by Federico Marani. “Practical Django 2 and Channels 2"

## What I will be building

- Online catalog
- Checkout process
- Internal dashboards
- Integrations with distribution companies
- Real-time components that will be used through a mobile application
- Mobile Application (I have never used ReactNative only done Flutter for some weeks, I am yet to decide)
- Recreate the web app with React and Typescript
- Whatever idea pops up in my head

## The project will be integrated with other libraries:

- Django-extensions
- factory_boy
- Django Debug Toolbar
- Django-tables2
- Django-filter
- Django Rest Framework
- Django Channels

## Django Channels

Channels is a project that takes Django and extends its abilities beyond HTTP - to handle WebSockets, chat protocols, IoT protocols, and more. It’s built on a Python specification called [ASGI](http://asgi.readthedocs.io/).

Django Channels is a new piece in the Django ecosystem that allows us to solve a class of problems that standard Django does not solve well: event-driven programming. Event-driven programming is the best paradigm to use when a system has high input/output load, which goes beyond normal HTTP request/response traffic. Chat systems fit in this, because people do not talk by following a request/response pattern.

## Contributions
